        <h1>Music!!!</h1>
        <h2>I make some music</h2>
        <p>And I have always thought about making a website to show it off
        so here I am starting to figure that out.</p>
        
        <h2>Why I love music</h2>
        <p>I love music because it is so irrefutably human. When music comes on
        people know that music has come on. The human brain can't help but to recognize
        organized sound. The brain can't help but to remember, feel, and try to make
        sense of the organized sound. Music is bigger than anything else in the room. 
        Music commands to be heard. Music can be the encompassment of raw emotion, it
        is emotion bundled up and to be experienced in real time. Music can 
        fill with joy or sorrow. Music is one of the most human things. </p>
        
        <h2>Un-tss Un-tss Un-tss Un-tss</h2>
        <p>My favorite kind of music is that of the electronic kind. I grew up
        on what some would call EDM, but I mostly now listen to techno and house
        although I'm not too picky when it comes to music. Anyway here's a little
        something I made a while back. Use headphones if you can.</p>

        <h2>All the music</h2>
        <p>I like to think that I don't love all types of music, yet.
        I feel like I will eventually get there as over time I have come to
        appreciate new genres as all music borrows from others. Last year I did an
        instrumental with a friend and I figured I would share part of that too
        since it was a collaboration I was really proud of. It is one thing to 
        produce music and something you like, it is another wonderful thing to 
        effectively communicate and collaborate with someone on such a delicate
        matter as making some tunes.</p>

        <h2>I mostly use a my laptop and FL Studio</h2>
        <p>I do have a single piece of hardware though, it is 
        a TR-09 drum machine and it is a lovely piece of gear that I
        enjoy performing on due to its classic sound and technical limitations
        which cause the user to be creative. The Tr-09 is a miniature version
        of the classic Roland TR-909 which is the sound of house music. House music
        by the way originated here in Chicago's south side.</p>
